I'm a Data Engineer at Sanford Health with a strong background in business analytics. I work on designing and implementing automated ETL solutions. My passion lies in tackling complex challenges that require deep research and analytical thinking. My professional journey includes valuable experience as a Data Engineer at Vodafone Telecommunications in India, along with successful completion of three major projects and various smaller initiatives during my academic career. I possess strong technical proficiency in modern data technologies including Snowflake, Spark, Python, and AWS services (S3, Redshift, Glue, EC2).
