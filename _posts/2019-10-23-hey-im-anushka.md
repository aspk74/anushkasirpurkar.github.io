title: Hey! I'm Anushka, nice to meet you!

I’m a data engineer with 3+ years of experience turning messy data into meaningful insights. I’ve worked across healthcare, fintech, and telecom—building scalable pipelines, migrating legacy systems to modern cloud platforms like AWS and Fabric, and designing clean, reliable data models that power hundreds of dashboards. I love working with Python, PySpark, Kafka, and dbt, and I’m big on data quality—shoutout to Great Expectations for helping me keep things clean!

Outside of coding, I enjoy writing about data workflows on Medium and experimenting with mini projects (like my PDF summarizer with ChatGPT!). Whether it's building real-time systems with Kinesis or optimizing ETL pipelines, I’m always up for solving hard data problems and making life easier for analysts, engineers, and stakeholders.
